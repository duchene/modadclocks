# Hybrid methods to obtain test statistics for model adequacy 

The hybrid methods used in the scripts here consist in using the simulated data to obtain phylograms. There exists a distribution of the length of each branch, generated from the PPS. For each branch in the real data we can obtain the quantile in the PPS. Then we can use the mean quantile.

An important problem with these methods is that if there is high variance in the estimates of the branch lengths, then the model will appear effective. The advantage is that it is much less intensive than predictive estimation methods.
